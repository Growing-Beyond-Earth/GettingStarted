# Thonny IDE with the Raspberry Pi Pico

In this first lesson, I will demonstrate how to use Thonny IDE and MicroPython on a Raspberry Pi Pico to do something simple with the Raspberry Pi Pico,

## Setup the environment
Let's begin by downloading [Thonny Python IDE for beginners ](https://thonny.org/).  Once Thonny is installed lets start by connecting the Raspberry Pi Pico to the computer via the USB cable. Start Thonny and Thonny should detect the Raspberry Pi Pico.

In the Thonny Tools menu, select "options", then "interpreter", and change the interpreter to the "MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)" option. Also select the correct connection port for the device.

The Raspberry Pi Pico comes with MicroPython already flashed. This means that it is literally "plug and play"

## Documentation

You can find information about the Raspberry Pi Pico on its  [Pico web page](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/raspberry-pi-pico.html).  The Raspberry Pi Pico is well-equipped with all sorts of GPIO and communications capabilities.

## Experiment

## Writing a Script

Create a new script with File>New and paste in the following code:


**NOTE: If you wish to run the code automatically whenever you power Raspberry Pi Pico then you have to name your code file as "main.py" while saving it.**

## More with MicroPython on Raspberry Pi Pico

For more physical computing projects to try on your Raspberry Pi Pico, grab a copy of the new book, Get Started with MicroPython on Raspberry Pi Pico. As well as learning how to use Raspberry Pi Pico’s pins as inputs and outputs, you’ll build a simple game, measure temperatures, save and load data to your Pico’s file system, and even make a burglar alarm for your room .
